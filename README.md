# HAppCakeGame
This is solution to a technical task for an image parser of a website

# Introduction
The UI of the app was designed on Figma and built with Unity 3D and C#. https://www.figma.com/file/pbAL4Op8doAmPifsD3BRZW/UNITY-Template?node-id=1768%3A22041
The main purpose of the app is to parse characters and animations from Mixamo site(https://www.mixamo.com/#/) and view it for dowmload on a mobile device.

#Version 1
This current version of this project tried parsing images from the HTML of the Mixamo website by accessing the div class product-image and getting the img attribute src in the CharacterViewer C# Script.
The code was able to connect with the Mixamo website but could not access the images/animations and render it on a texture dynamically.
